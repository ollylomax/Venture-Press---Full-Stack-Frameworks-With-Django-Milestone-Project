# Venture Press Website

I built this website using my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Python, PostgresSQL and Django which I have learned from Code Institute during my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. Venture Press is an imaginary brand that I have created to showcase my knowledge and skills in the aforementioned languages and frameworks with the intention of completing my Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project.

The websiteâ€™s purpose is to deliver an E-Commerce platform for a domestic printing company, offering a wide range of print services which are all purchasable through a cart and checkout flow.
